# Functions

* Functions are the core of the spec.
* You can combine function calls to create new functions
* A function takes multiple named inputs and outputs multiple named outputs
* Inputs and Outputs MUST be typed.

## Atomic Functions

* Are functions that get impelemented once, and don't depend on other functions, e.g. :
    * Variable creation/assignment (`int x = 10`)    
    * math operations like addition, subtraction, etc...
    * IO operations like networking calls, file access, etc...    
    * And many more ...
* These are the minimum amount of functions that need to be implemented in order to use this specification
* These functions will have Defs, but no implementations

## Composite Functions

* Are functions that call other Atomic or composite functions

## Proposed Spec
